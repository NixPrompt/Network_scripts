# FoxOps CLI

A dependency-free Python CLI for auditing network reachability and local Windows
hardening posture against defined baselines.

The tool is designed for NOC/SOC-style checks: readable console output,
structured JSON for automation, timestamped logs, clear exit codes, and no
automatic remediation.

## Mission Statement

FoxOps-CLI helps operators turn small, explicit infrastructure questions into
repeatable evidence. It should stay safe to run, simple to explain, and useful
under pressure: read-only checks, deterministic output, clear failure messages,
and artifacts that can be pasted into tickets or reviewed later.

The project favors trustworthy observations over broad claims. FoxOps reports
what the local runner can actually see; it does not certify that a system is
secure, remediate findings, or scan targets that were not explicitly provided.

Disclaimer: this tool reports specific observed findings from the runner's point
of view. It does not prove a system is secure, replace endpoint protection, or
perform remediation.

## Current Capabilities

- Cross-platform network checks:
  - DNS resolution
  - ICMP ping
  - TCP port reachability
  - HTTP status checks for URLs
  - TLS certificate expiry checks for HTTPS URLs
  - Repeated or comma-separated multi-host input
  - Hosts-file input for repeatable target lists
  - Optional bounded network concurrency with deterministic output order
- Windows hardening audit:
  - Built-in `Guest` account disabled
  - Built-in `Administrator` account disabled
  - Current main user requires a password
  - Minimum password length policy
  - Lockout threshold, duration, and observation window
- Operator output:
  - Stable check IDs
  - `OK`, `WARN`, and `FAIL` statuses
  - `actual` and `required` fields where applicable
- Automation output:
  - Run-level JSON metadata
  - JSON summary
  - Host-grouped network results
  - Per-host grouped summaries
  - Hardening result group
  - Flat result list
  - Optional JSON file output with parent directory creation

```

## Quick Start

Canonical demo command:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --hosts-file .\examples\hosts.txt --port 443 --workers 4 --output json
```

Run a network check:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --host google.com --port 443
```

Open the local evidence dashboard demo:

```powershell
node .\dashboard\server.mjs
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/dashboard/`.

Run multiple host checks:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --host google.com,github.com,1.1.1.1 --port 443
```

Run checks from a hosts file:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --hosts-file .\hosts.txt --port 443 --output json
```

Write JSON to a file while keeping JSON on stdout:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --hosts-file .\hosts.txt --port 443 --output json --output-file .\reports\latest.json
```

Run web checks for an HTTP or HTTPS URL:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --url https://example.com --output json
```

Try the included sample file:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --hosts-file .\examples\hosts.txt --port 443 --workers 4 --output json
```

Hosts files accept one hostname or IP per line. Blank lines and lines starting
with `#` are ignored. Comma-separated entries are also accepted.

Example `hosts.txt`:

```text
# public targets
google.com
github.com

# local edge checks
192.168.1.1
1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8
```

Combine ad hoc hosts with a repeatable hosts file:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --host emergency-router.example.com --hosts-file .\hosts.txt --port 443
```

If the hosts file is missing or unreadable, the CLI exits with runtime error
code `2`.

Run Windows hardening audit from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --hardening --output json
```

Run network and hardening checks together:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --host github.com --port 443 --hardening --output json
```

Use a custom timeout or log file:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --host 8.8.8.8 --port 53 --timeout 2 --log-file .\logs\network.log
```

Run multi-host checks with bounded network concurrency:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --hosts-file .\hosts.txt --port 443 --workers 4 --output json
```

`--workers` defaults to `1`. Windows hardening checks remain sequential.

On Windows, use `py`, `python`, or a full Python path depending on local PATH
setup.

## Runtime Notes

- Network checks are cross-platform and describe connectivity from the runner's
  point of view.
- URL checks use HTTP `HEAD` requests and read-only TLS certificate inspection.
- TLS certificate checks run for HTTPS URLs. HTTP URLs report a `WARN` skip for
  TLS.
- TLS certificate status is `FAIL` when expired, `WARN` when expiring in 30 days
  or less, and `OK` beyond that window.
- Windows hardening checks should be run from Windows PowerShell.
- If hardening cannot run on the current host, the tool reports `WARN` and exits
  cleanly.
- Under WSL, hardening reports `source=wsl`, explains that WSL is not
  authoritative for Windows local users or password policy, and tells operators
  to rerun from Windows PowerShell.
- Remediation is explicitly out of scope.
- Future automated changes should follow
  [`docs/AGENT_RULES.md`](docs/AGENT_RULES.md).

## Hardening Baseline

Hardening mode is audit-only. It reads local Windows state and does not change
users, password policy, firewall rules, services, registry settings, or packages.

Note: In FoxOps, "hardening" means a read-only posture audit against selected
baseline expectations. The tool reports observed hardening posture; it does not
apply hardening, remediate findings, or claim that the system is secure.

Current baseline:

- Guest account: disabled
- Administrator account: disabled
- Main user password: required
- Minimum password length: `>= 12`
- Lockout threshold: `1-10` attempts
- Lockout duration: `>= 10` minutes
- Lockout observation window: `>= 10` minutes

Example text output:

```text
[OK] account_hardening.Guest actual=disabled required=disabled - Guest account is disabled
[OK] account_hardening.Administrator actual=disabled required=disabled - Administrator account is disabled
[OK] account_hardening.ASUS1 actual=required required=required - ASUS1 requires a password
[FAIL] account_policy.min_password_length actual=0 required=>=12 - Minimum password length is 0; required >= 12
[OK] account_policy.lockout_threshold actual=10 required=1-10 - Lockout threshold is 10 attempts
```

## JSON Output

Use JSON for automation:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --host example.com --port 443 --output json
```

Persist the same JSON payload to a file:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --host example.com --port 443 --output json --output-file .\reports\example.json
```

FoxOps creates parent directories for `--output-file` when possible. If the
file cannot be written, it prints a clear `[FAIL]` message to stderr and exits
with runtime error code `2`. Output files are currently supported for JSON runs
only.

JSON includes run metadata, a summary, grouped results, and the full flat result
list. Top-level key order is stable: `metadata`, `summary`, `groups`, `results`.

```

See [`examples/sample-output.json`](examples/sample-output.json) for the same
network-only JSON example as a standalone file.

## Logging

Each result is written to the selected log file with a timestamp and stable
key-value fields.

Default log path:

```text
monitor.log
```

Example log line:

```text
2026-05-04T15:48:22-0700 INFO check=account_policy.min_password_length status=FAIL actual=0 required=>=12 message=Minimum password length is 0; required >= 12
```

See [`examples/sample-monitor.log`](examples/sample-monitor.log) for a short
network-check log example.

## Exit Codes

```text
0  All checks returned OK or WARN only
1  One or more checks returned FAIL
2  CLI/runtime error before checks could complete
```

## Running Tests

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

For manual validation before larger merges, see
[`docs/SMOKE_TESTS.md`](docs/SMOKE_TESTS.md).

GitHub Actions runs the pytest suite on push and pull request.

## Troubleshooting

### Python Not Found

On Windows, `python` may not be on `PATH`. Try the Python launcher:

```powershell
py .\monitor.py --host google.com --port 443
```

You can also use a full path to a Python executable.

### Ping Unavailable

If the runner cannot execute `ping`, the ping check reports `WARN` and the TCP
port check still runs. This keeps the network check useful on stripped-down
hosts or locked-down shells.

### PowerShell Vs WSL Hardening

Windows hardening checks should be run from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py --hardening --output json
```

If you run from WSL or another non-Windows context, FoxOps reports a `WARN`
capability result instead of claiming Windows authority.

WSL output is intentionally specific:

```text
[WARN] capability.hardening source=wsl reason=not_authoritative_for_windows_hardening action=run_from_windows_powershell - skipped: WSL is a Linux environment and is not authoritative for Windows local users or password policy; run from Windows PowerShell instead
```

Native Linux and macOS also skip Windows hardening with `WARN`, but they report
their own runner source, such as `source=linux` or `source=darwin`.

### Missing Hosts File

If `--hosts-file` points to a missing or unreadable file, FoxOps prints a clear
`[FAIL]` message to stderr and exits with runtime error code `2`.

## Roadmap

See `TODO.md` for planned work, including tests, CI, SMB/File Sharing audits,
Linux/WSL hardening, configurable baselines, and a design-only future `--fix`
discussion.

Remediation remains explicitly out of scope.
